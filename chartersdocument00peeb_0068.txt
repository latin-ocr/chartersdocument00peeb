entitled ί((301111105111011 for Remiszion to the Bailies, Councillors, and Com-
munity of Peeblesy for their treasonable adherence to the English‚” 1.'›th
June 1551 (No. XXXIII. p. 65). The community is stated to have tremon-
ably adhered to “ the old enemies of England,’' after the battle of Pinkie-
cleugh, “ for a period of fifteen weeks or thereabouts in time of war.” The
composition or fine for this grave offence is seen to have been §200,*0f
course in Scots money, being about ‘1316 135. 411. sterling. The Burgh
Records, not being complete. at this period, contain no notice of the Pinkie-
cleugh affair, 1101· os the fine imposed 011 account of it. We only learn
incidentally that the town was visited by a military force who burnt St
Andrcw’s Church. Very meagre notices of the event occur 111 1555
(11. 215), 1556 (11236), and also under the date 11th December 1560

The invaders committed a still greater atrocity. They cruelly burnt the
town. Birrel in his Diccrys briefly refers to the event as follows: “ Peebles

western 1011101103, joined by the Earl of Lennox, who commanded the Scottish

The escapade connected with Pinkiecleugh, in which the people of Peebles
were not singular, does not seem to have been remembered vengefully
against the burgh. All things went on as usual, and again there was some
experience of royal favour. Queen Mary, by a charter under the great seal,
of new erected the burgh of Peebles into a free royal burgh, with liberty to
hold markets and fan—s, and with other privileges specilied 10 ancient infest-
ments. It is dated Peebles, 17th December 1554 (No. XXXIV. p. Gb').
As seen by an extract from 1110 Burgh Records (p. 209), “an honest and
discreet man, Mungo 1Υ111111111500,”0101101νο1οἀ by letters from the Queen,
