for the new parish church. As regards the town wall of 1569, 11 existed,
though in a dilapidated condition, until the middle of the eighteenth
century. In 1758 the council resolvcd to take down the West Port, and
level the port 111110, in order to make a more commodious entry to the town.
Cleared away by this and other operations, the wall generally disappeared
about the year 1800, leaving only a few fragments, the largest of which,
near the East Port, has already been referred to.

We conclude by calling attention to a few points of general interest
in the earlier extr-acts. In these, some curicus¹ notices occur respecting
a branch of civic administration, in regard to which we have no very definite
informatiou. We refer to the dousan or council of the burgh, which seems
to have varied in its numbers from 21 to 25, and the inquest or queist
composed of persons numbering from 12 to 21. thether the inquest was
a different body from the domam, or was composed of members of the
(lousan or of private inhabitants called upon sometimes to advise with the
bailies on special occasions, or on others 10 1101 as a jury and determine
special questions of fact, is not by any means clear. Both conjec-
tures seem to derive 0111111011 from various acts. Probably the records of
other burghs may afford more definite informati‹;›n on this subject. Mean-
while we can only call attention to the fact that the dousan and the
inquest both appear to have. possessed considerable authority as regards
the guanlianship of the burgh, the regulation of prices, and matters
of police. The constant interserence of the. inquest with traders and
mcrchandise, forms a prominent feature in the reem-ds, and gives an im-
pressive idea of that mischievous meddlesomencss with the free current of
trade and the prices of labour which once prevailed in Scottish burghs.

From innumerable entries, we learn that fines for underselling, and for a
variety of petty offences, formed a prolific source of burghal revenue.
