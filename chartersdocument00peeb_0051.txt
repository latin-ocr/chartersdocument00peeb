1863, when preparing materiale for the HISTORY OF
Q. PEEBLESSHIRE‚ I applied to Mr John Bathgate, then Town
³* Clerk of Peebles, for liberty to examine the Charters of the
Burgh, the Burgh Council Records, and such other papers of
an old date as might prove serviceable. The required liberty was granted 3
but 10 consequence of alleged losses, the documents submittcd for inspection
were comparatively few in number. The only charter that could be
produced, was that of James IV. (1506), wanting the seal. All the others
were missing, inclusive of the great chartei· of J ames VI. (1621) ; 1110 only
thing that could be shown for which was a copy of an imperfect English
translation, printed 111 1110 form of a small tract 111 1825. As regards
1110 Records of the Town Council, 1110 oldest began on 4th October 1456,
and broke off abruptly in 1483. There was then a blank until 1652,
when the Records were resumed, and continued with breaks of several years
at a time. The two older volumes resembled bunches of discoloured leaves,
in a tattered condition; no care apparently having been taken for their
proper preservatum. I was consequently unable to present that con-
tinuous and vivid account of the Burgh transactions reflecting 011 social
history which would have been so very desirable. There matters rested
until 1110 work of collecting and printing documents for the SCOTTIsH
BURGH RECORDS SOCIETY, led to renewed inquiries, 111 1110 present year,
concerning the charters and records of Peebles.

The honour of discovering the missing doeuments, all of deep public
