siduam curam et singulare studium que nos nostrique nobilissimi progenitores
dignissime memorie in burgorum regalium erectione infra regnum nostrum
Scotie contulimus, in quorum incremento civilitas, emolumentum et eiusdem
regni decus consistunt, ipsumque quotidie augetur et ditatur-3 ac nos in
memoriam revocantes antiquam erectionem burgi nostri de Peblis, egregia
beneficia et memorabilia ac grata servicia per ballivos, consules, burgenses
et communitatem dicti burgi nostri de Peblis, absque vlla suspicione, culpa aut

non solum adversus hostes externos patriam propugnando, verum ctiam cor-
