now called the Lidgate‚ a corruption of [θοὴ-(γαθή signifying the way by which
the dead were carried to the churchyard of St Andrew, the access to which
was on the east. By a small effort of the imagination, we are therefore to
contemplate the Old Town as having covered several fields behind the present
houses, and as being the residence of a numerous body of clergy, including
the Abbot of Aberbrothock, when, with a retinue of inonks (as indicated in
the Grant, No. IV., page 6), he visited the Hospicium connected with his

Old Town. XVhen the Nau> Town, or the Peebles proper of modern times,
was built, is not indicated by any record, and we are left to form an opinion
on the subject from general but very conclusive circumstances. The open
ground, dignified by the Church of St Andrew and the Church of the Holy
Cross, was wholly indefensible. The houses were liable to attack, and
could be easily destroyed by an enemy from the English border. Hence
arose a necessity for building the town on the adjoining peninsula, formed
