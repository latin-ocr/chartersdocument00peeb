them Pebgfll, 011 a broad alluvial plateau 011 the north bank of the Tweed.
From this British term Pebyll, signifying tents, the town takes its present
name, which has undergone several rnutations. In old charters the place
is called Peblis. There, on that level spot, did the town first assume a
distinct slmpe, and there were the ecclesiastica] glories of Peebles deve-
loped. From these circumstances, the cluster of houses in this quarter is
locally spoken of as the Old Town.

Until it was extended by modern additions, the Old Town appeared to be
only the. fragment of what had at one time covered a much larger space of
ground, in which the present roadways are presumed to mark the lines of
ancient streetS. Two or three leading facts present themselves. By David
1„ while still only Prince of Cumbria‚ the sce of Glasgow was re-invigorated
and 10-0111111111011, 1116; and shortly after this, in the arrangement of the
see into lesser ecclesiastiea] divisions, Pecbles, with a group of parishes,
became a deanery 111 the arclnleaconry of Teviotdale, with a resident dean,
the immediate superior of the niinistering clergy within his jurisdiction.
The next important fact was the founding of the parish church of Peebles‚
dedicated to St Andrew, on the site, as is believed, of a more ancient build-
ing. This event occurred in 1195, under the auspices of Bishop Joceline
of Glasgmv, This St Andrew's Church, as it was called, is frequently
referred to in the charters and records connected with the burgh. A third
fact of some importance was the founding and endowing of the Church of the
Holy Cross, or Holy Rood, by Alexander HL, 1261. As St Andrew’s Church
became a collegiate institution, with a provest, and twelve prebendaries
serving at so many altars, and as the Church of the Holy Cross was consti-
tuted a monastery, with seventy red or Trinity friars, the number of eecle-
siastics at these two establishments alone was very considerable. Both
churches were placed in the Old Town, at the distance, in a straight line,
of about a quarter of a mile from each other3 the street between them form-
ing a convenient ecclesiastical thoroughfare. A cross roadway‚ leading from
an open quadrangular space in the old town, which had been the original
market-place of the town, to the thoroughfare between the two churches, is
