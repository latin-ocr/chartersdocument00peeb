of the present volume. The actual labour contributed by him in trmiscribing
those portions of the chartersÂ¹ of 1621 which he was enabled to decipher,
and afterwards in collating that and other charters, was very great3 but, iu
addition to these acts of kindlgess, he has always been ready to make his
great knowledge and experience available in any difficulty. Thanks
are also very specially due to Mr John Stuart, LL.D., aud to Mr George
B. Robertson, Deputy Keeper of the Records, for their willing and
valuable counsel and active aid. Nor is it possible to exaggerate the value
of the service rendered by Mr Renwick, to whose unremitting zeal and
painstaking industry this volume mainly owes its existence.
