From numerous entries in thc 19901115, it 15 0115911911 that at this period
the community were in 1111 exceedingly perturbed condition, and the misery
that prevailed among the humbler 91115595 15 very clearly indicated by the
frequent notice of “pykaris‚’' or stenlers of petty articles, 511911 as 119115,
kale, peats, &o (pp. 221-4). In 1555 watchmen were appointed to keep
watch during the night, and from that time till 1573, the 19901115 applicahle

the watch were passed. The principal orders of this kind will be found in
the extracts, 0119 of which, passed in 1557, provided that at any sudden
