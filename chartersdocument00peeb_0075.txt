Unhappily, while the whole district of country from the Merse to Dum-
friesshire was a scene of 1113611161, the general dissensions were imitated on a
minor but not 1633 raneorous scale by the burgesses of Peebles, who among
themselves seolded, quarrellerL and fought, used towards each other oppro-
brious epithets in open couneil, constantly disagreed about rights to 60111-
111011 property, and at times⁷ out of malice or an inclinatior] for plunder,
committed crimes which brought them within the scrutiny ofthe higher courts.

No name occurs more frequently in the 16601113 during the fifteenth and
sixteenth century than that of Dickison or Dykisoun. The Dickisons were
proprietors of WVinkston, a property situated about a mile north from the
town, and bounded by certain commons pertaining to the burgh. Con-
cerning the marches, there appear to have been disputes between william
Diekison and John his son and heir, and the burgh 111 1555 (p. 213).
Although trusted, and raised to the position of a bailie, John Dickison was
evidently a troublesome individual. From what cause, whether from a
revival of the dispute about the marehes, or otherwise, a bad feeling grew
up in the town against him, and 116 was at length barbarously murderod on
the lst July 1572. Of this lamentable event, the records take no notice,
except in a casua] way. On the (lay following the murder, William
Dickison of Winkst0n‚ for himself and his kinsmen, promises to live peace-
ably in time to come, and the bailies and community in like manner under-
take not 10 11101631 him and his friends. But though only incidentnlly
referred to 11616 and elsewhere 111 1116 16601113 the fact of the slaughter
is undoubted; for it was the subject of judicial inquiry. On the 19111
July the same year, James Tweedie, John VVychtman, Martin Hay, niul
John Bullo, all of Peebles, and Thomas 5011113106, 3011 of Thomas Johnston of
Craigieburn, were tried at the High Court of Justiciary, ‘for the cruel
slaughter of the late John Diekisone of XVynkstonef The assize acquitted
them, with only one dissentient.l According to a tradition which lingered
in the town till within the last fifty years, the murder was committed in the
High street, near the Dean's Gutter.
