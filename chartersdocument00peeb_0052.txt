xlviii PREFACE.

interest, belongs to ΜΓ J. D. MARWICK, Town-Clerk of Edinburgh, Secretary
of the BURGH RECORDs SOCIETY‚ aided by his two assis-tants, Mr Alexander
Harris, and Μι- Robert Renwick. The following account of this notable
discovery, furnished to me in a communication from ΜΓ Renwick, during
Mr Marwick’s absence on the continent, will be read with interest :—

“The extracts from the earliest extant volume of the Records of the Town
Council of Peebles, given by you in your “History of Pceblesshire,⁷' attracted
ΜΓ Murwick‘s attention, from the curicus glinipses they afford of burghal life in
the south of Scotland towards the close of the fifteenth century. He accordingly
applied to Mr J. D. Bathgnte, the present town clerk, for 1111 inspectior] of the
volume, which was at once sent to him, along with the volume of transcripts which
111111 boen made sor you when preparing your volume, 111111 which you 111111 presented to
the town. An exumination of these, and especially of the original volume, satisfied
him that the Peebles Records were worthy of early attention by the Burgh Records
Society, 111111 Ι was asked to make the requi-site extracts with 11 view to publication.

“ After these extr-acts 111111 been made, it was considered desirable to print such
of the oldest charters of the burgh as could be collected, but only a very few char-
ters could be. discovered 111 the ordinary repositories of the town.

‘⁶ NVhen the chartei-s were being collected, Μι- Marwick wished me to examine
Macfirrlane’s MS. Collection, p1·escrve1.l in the libr-ary of the Faculty of Advocates,
in the hope of finding sonie truce of the Chai-ter of Erection of the Collegiate Church
of St AndreW. Being unsucccssful in that quarter, Mi· David Laing suggested
that I might look with the same object into General Hutton's MS. collection, made
for his contemplated Monnstic Histoi-y of Scotland, and preserved in the same library.
Ι 11111 so, 111111 was agreeably surprised to find two quarto volumes, prepared between
the years 1800 and 1813, entirely devoted to tmnscripts of charters and extracts from
the records of Peebles. Μι- Marwick thereupon obtained permission from the
curators of the library to make a cnresul inspection of these volumes, and he selected
for transcription und publication in the present volume such charters as were con-
nected more speciully with the burgh. It was impossible however, to doubt that
the Genera] must have 111111 access to many of- the chartei-s which had subsequently
dis-appeared. The minute description which the voluines contained of many of these
doculnents afforded conclusive evidence of this3 and, is the writings were of great
interest, and it was excecdingly desirablc to have the proof-sheets collated with the
originaLs, if they could possibly be discovered, Mr 111-1111111011 applied to Mr Bathgate,
