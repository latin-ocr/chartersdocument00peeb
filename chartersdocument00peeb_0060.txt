a royal eastle on the prominent knoll by which the peninsula is terminated
on the west. We hear of this castle 111 1116 reign of Edward I. It seems
inore than prohahle that the new town assumed a determinate shape in the
course of 1116 twelfth and thirteenth centuries. 11 was built in a manner
hefitting a seat of population exposed to predatory encroaehnient. To this
point we have to clraw particular attention.

In the Old Town there is not a vestige of any castellated or defensible
edifiee. The whole, even in the best (lays of the place, had consisted of a
plain class of dwellings, 11161611611, and liable to instant destruction. There
is no appearance of an environing wall. The two churehes might at any
time hare been assailed, and their respective communities dispersed or put
under eontribution. The very existence of a town, so open to invasion, 111
the vale of Tweeal, is a significant token of international peacefulness pre—
vious to 1116 thirteenth century.

Tho new town was connneneed and continued for several centuries on an
entirely different footing. It became a species of bordei· garrison,—an out-
post, so 10 speak, of Edinburgh. The site of the new town is nothing
inore than a mass of diluvial gmvel, the relic of some early geological
movement. The surface of the peninsular mass 13 a height of about sixty feet
from the Tweed on the one side, and the Peehles or Eddleston water on the
other, affording space for a good broad street, lying east and west, with diverg-
ing 610363 01· lanes 011 each side. The street is generally called the “ Hie

ordinarily spoken of as 1116 North and South Raw. Such was the main
thoroughfare‚ or High Street, on which inarkets and fairs were held. Here,
towards the eastern extreinity of the street, stood the market cross, which
was a plain, octangular structure, with a central shaft, as renovated in
1699. From this structure, of which we give a representation as it
appeared immediately before its removal (1807), royal proclamations were
made. It was likewise the scene of burghal and other ceremonies
requiring publicity. The cross was also used as a pillory for criminals.
