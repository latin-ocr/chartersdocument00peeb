PREFACE. li

quent to 1714, were known to, and havebeen largely used by, you in the preparation
of your History of Peeblesshire. It is accordingly understood that, from 1604 to the
present time, with the exception of the part applicable to the four years from 1616
to 1620, and a few leaves at the end of volume 1650-52, the Council Records are corn-
plete. The Burgh Court Books which have been found of a date subsequent to 1623,
consist of three volumes, and extend from that time down to 1704 continuously.

“ The Treasurer⁷s accounts, containing a number of curious and interesting
items, embrace the following periods 2—1554‚ 1623-39, 1645-6, 1650-1, and
1652-65.”

“ The greater number of the volumes being provided with parchment covers are
in a fair state of preservation, but others not similarly protected have suffered in
consequence. Several leaves have been altogether lost, and others in a loose state
are out of their places. Mr. Bathgate is anxious to get the whole of the Records
bound in a style uniform with the first volume, and when this is done the volumes
will, to a large extent, be secured against farther deterioration.''

This explanatory statement by ΜΓ Renwick leaves little to be said of a
prefatory nature. The missing chartei-s and records being largely recovered,
an opportunity for giving them publicity has occurred in the volume now
issued by the BURGH RECORDS SOCIETY. The originals having been re-
turned to the proper quarter‚ are now fittingly preserved in a fire-proof
depository.

The charters and general (locuments presented are not numerous; but,
besides being locally valuable, they form a fair contribution to antiquarian
and ecclesiastical literature. With respect to the extracts offered from the
Burgh Records, beginning with 1456, they will be found to possess that
degree of interest which it is the object os the Burgh Records Society to
cultivate. To assist in promoting that object, I have drawn on some
persona] knowledge of the antiquities connected with Peebles‚ and thrown
together the following observations and notes, in the form of an Introduc-
tion, Historical and Topographic, illustrated by a few wood engravings.

Mr Marwick is particularly desirous that acknowledgment may be made here
of the valuable services generously rendered by Mr Thomas Dickson, Curator
of the Historical Department in the Genera] Register House, in the preparation
