of having their offices (leclared vacant. This would seem to indicate a laxity
of the ecclesiastica] system on the eve of the Reformation in Scotland.

The Reformation being effer-ted, and the old endownicnts appropriated
by the nobility and gentry—the yearly value derived from some of the
111-01100113, however, being still under the administration of the burgh
(p. 335)—the ecclesiastical system in Peeblcs was put on a very modest
footing 3 for a time it consisted of only a single exhorter, named
John Dikeson, whose annual stipend amounted to no more than forty
merks.''¹ St Andrew’s Church was allowed to fall to ruin. For upwards of
a century the structure has consisted of only a massive square tower, and a
few broken walls——the grassy sward of its interior being dotted over with
modern grave-stones. The cha-pel of the Virgin Mary in the High Street,
becoming burgh property, was used occasionally for religious purposes until
its removal in 1780. The 01033 0111111111 was used as the parish church
until 1784, when the congregation removed to a new church of a poor style
of architecture, erected on the site of the 0113110 of Peebles. At the spot

way was 1111011011, and over it is the inscription—‘⁴ FEIRE GOD, 1656.” The
church had five windows on the southern side, in which was the main
entrance. Between the third window and the door there was a small apcrture
and arch, 30 constructed 113 to make it probable to the antiquaries of last cen-
tury that the reliques of St Nicholas and the Holy 01033 had been deposited
there, so that they might be seen as well without as within the 011111011.2

The cloisters and other buildings occupied by the monastice of the 01033
01111101] were situated 011 1110 north side of the edifice. They had formed a
quadrangle. The chief building, erected over a vault, consisted of a single
apartment, which was reached by an outside flight of steps. On one side
there was an opening from the apartment into the church. Probably this
had been the apartment used by the superior, who could at any time, by
means of the opening, observe the proceedings of the monks and other
