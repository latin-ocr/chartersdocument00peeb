lxxii INTRODUCTION.

The [wrl‘vlexing thing about this unhappy affair is, that the murdered
man is spoken of traditionally as ‘Provost Dickisonj and he is also, as
will be seenv referred to as *provost' 111 an 01111)ν 111 the council records,
lst March 1682. Now⁷ it is proper to say, that at the time of the
murder the 111-«111151 of the burgh was ‘William Lord Hay of Yester,’ who
was elected for a year, 1 6111 October 1571 (p. 329). We, indeed, do not find
any entry as to Dic-kison ever being appointed provost. The only explana-
tion we can offer is, that Dickison had perhaps acted for some time as chief
magistrate, or depute provost‚ for Lord Hay of Yester was frequently
absent, and was in fact little better than an ornmnental official.

From entries 111 the Privy Council Reoords, quoted in the H {story of
Peeblcsshlre, the sends, slaughters, and disorders in the county during the
latter part of the sixteenth century fill the modern reader with astonish-
ment. At this period, James VI. several times· visited Peebles either to
hold summary courts on disturbem of the peace, or in the more vain
attempt to compost* the sends of the gentry. In the history of the town,
are seen on a limited scale, the efforts of the monarehy to secure the
allegiance of the burglis as a make-weight against the ambitious and
dangemus tendencies of the higher class of nobles. All the charters granted
to Peebles, us to other burg-hs, by the old [ὃς-11111311 sovereigns are traceable to
this sagacioris poliey. James VI.‚ after he had aseended the throne of
England, gave a chartei· to the burgh, which remains the golden chartei· of
the cmmuuuity, and is that commonly quoted.

This great charter, which amplifies.¹ all the privileges formerly conceded,
is a chau-tor of confirmation and novodamus. It was granted by James VI.
to the Provost, Bailies, and Councillors¹ of the Burgh of Peebles, 19111
November 1021 (No. XL„ p. 70). This eopious dcwument may be consulted
sor an account of the many privileges and possessions conferred from time
to time on tho burgh. From the explanations already offered, it is evident
that great paine have been taken to give a perfect transeript and translation
of this important document. As no such trouble had been incurred 111
effecting a transeript of the charter hitherto 111 use, the burgh now for the
