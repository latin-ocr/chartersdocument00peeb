lviii INTRODUCTION.

generally called, renders it proper to explain the nature os the old street
architectum in PeebleS‚ and the means taken for defence of the burgh.
Around the town there were continuous stone dykes, with four prineipal
entrances or ports, and ultimately, as will be afterwards notieed, the dykes
were supersede'd by a very sufficient wall. With its castle, the burgh had,
therefore, a considerably defensive aspect. But the inhabitants did not alto-
gether rely on these means of security. The dwellings on both sides of the
High Street, and also some dwellings 111 the closes, were strongly built as
bustel-houses. The name bastel-house was applied to a dwelling constructed
with its ground floor as an arehed vault, the
apartments above being reached by an outside
stair. In cases of expected attack, the burgesses

able wealth as they prized, in these vaults, which

bably had not suffered much material damage.

In all the Scottish towns near the berder there were bastel-houses of
this kind, and even now⁷ after ages of tranquillity, they have not disappeared.
Scott, in his ‘⁴ Border Antiquitie5‚'’ 101, i. p. lxiv„ makes the following
reference to them :—“ Lesudden‚ a populous village, when burned by Sir
Ralph Evers, in 1544, contained no less than sixteen strong bustel-houses3
and Jedburgh, when taken and burned by the Earl of Surrey, contained six
of these strongholds, with many good houses besides, was twice as large as
the town of Berwiek, and could have aceommmlated a garrison of a thousand
cavalry. The defence of these towns was very obstinate, the people theni—
selves pulling down the thatch of their houses, and burning it in the streets

to stop the progress of their enemies.'’ As lately as the beginning of the
