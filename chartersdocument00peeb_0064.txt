lx μ INTRODUCTJON.

‘² Nicholas, the son of John, and John, the son of William,''—such‚ perhaps
being tho first time representatives were ever sent from Peebles. The
same persons² as representing Peebles, also coneurred with the representa-
tives of fifteen other burghs in the appointment of procuratum to concur in
any treaty, and to undertake whatever obligatior] might be necessary, to
effect the ransom and release of the king.

By the arrangements 011 this occasion, tho English elaims on scotland wore
finally extinguislied. The bordei· line now shifts back to the former boundary,
and Peebles resumes its status as a free Scottish burgh. After this event, the
first eoinnuinieati«›11 made to Peeblcs· by David Il. consisted of letters to the
bailies, burgesseS, and connnunity, Sth March 1362-ss (No. V. p. 8) clmrging
then] to :issign a, fitting place or stance for building “ a certain chapel iu
honour of the gloricnis Virgin Mary the mother of G0d.'’ This request was
coniplied with. Tho spot assigned for the ehapel was in the High Stmet,
near the (1115111- of Peebles3 and for its suppmt David, by a charter, granted
the mill of Innerleithen. This oharter 15 in existence, but it lias not been
deelnod necessary to print it.

The country at large suffered the calaniity of civil wars and dison-bancos,
during the rcgency of the two dukes of Albany⁷ father and son, at the conclu-
sion of the f‹‚›urteenth and beginning of the fifteenth century. The precarious
condition of the burgh during this dismal period 15 evident from a passage
in one of the old rhyining chronic-los. About 1406, Sir Robert Umphraville,
vice-admiral of England, made an ineursion into Seotland, and attacking the
town of Peebles on a market·day‚ made great spoil of the warns there eol-
lected, causing his men to measure out the eloth with their bows and spezu's.
The affair 15 mentioned in Hardyng’s le'oozicle (1543), and it is stated
that Uniphraville hence acquired the name of Robin Mendlnarket :—

⁴⁴ At Peemes . . . .
He brent the town upon their market-day,
And mete their eloth with spears and bows sere,
By his bidding without any nay3
Wherefore, the Seots fron] heueeforward ay
Called him Robin Mendlnarket in certain,
For his measures were so large and plaiu.“
