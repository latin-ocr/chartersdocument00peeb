INTHODUCTION. lxi

In consequence of the loss of its more ancient charters, however incurred,
the burgh can point to no existing document of this kind earlier than one
granted by James H. at the middle of the. fifteenth century. Celebrity 1133
been given to the town by the interesting poeni, entitled Peebles to ilco Plags,
commonly, but without any absolute warrant, ascribed to James 1., 31111
believed to have been written about 1430. If that accomplishcd 31111
unfortunate monarch, who was murdered at Perth in 1437, conferred any
special token of his royal favour, the fact is not recorded. The charter
given by his son and successor, James II., purports to be to the burgesses 31111
community of Peebles, and is dated 5th February 1451-52 (No. IX. p. 16).
It proceeds on the grounds “ that 111 times long past by the hazards of war,
and by fire, the charters, evidents‚ and several deeds of infeftment, granted
to their predecessors 31111 them, 11311 been destroyed, burned, 31111 annulled.’'

Among the charters will be observed (No. VIII. p. 14) 311 indenture
entered into between the bailies and burgesses and Sir william Adcsoun, a
priest of Peebles‚ ordaining an obit of masscs to be done at Saint Michael's
altar, 31111 0111 Lady's altar. This document is dated 3d September 1450.
Of the original, which is 111 English, 3 facsimile is given at the beginning
of the present volume. According to the indenture, nine masses were to
be done annually, on behalf of certain persenis specified, on the 3d of June,
but if that day fell on a Saturday, Sunday, or any solemn holy day, the
masses were to be (lelayed to the following Monday. The whole arrangement
regarding these masses tbrows an interesting light on ecclesiastical history.

With respect to Saint Michael, mention is often made in the records of
the service to be rendered at the altar of that puis-sant and greatly venerated
archangel. Various pieces of 131111 about the town were appropriated to the
support of 1113 chaplain. From the Burgh Records, loth May 1462 (p. 142),
we 103111 that the altar was provided with 311 image of Saint MichacL which
was made to take part in the ceremony of infesting persons in the 1311113 set
apart in his honour. A bailie, with witnesses, having attended for the
purpose of giving possession of certain lands from which an annual was
