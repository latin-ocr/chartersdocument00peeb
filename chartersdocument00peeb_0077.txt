first time after a long period, is put in possession of a complete and trust-
worthy copy. The privileges conferrcd by the charter remain, modified
by modern legislation ; where the many possessione are, it would bc painful
to consider. In this respect, Peebles has not been exemptcd from the fate
of most royal burghs favoured by the munificence of royal and other donors.

The records and accounts afford 501116. 611110115 information regarding the
troops of the Connnonwealth which were quartered in the town; and at
a subsequent period we also find a few incidents connected with the troubles
which sprang up in Scotland, consequent 011 1116 obligation to take 1116 ‘test’
Of this test, which drove the Covenantcrs to the 111115, we observe that 011 0116
occasion certain magistrates and councillors refused to take it. But afterwards
the members of council became more pliable. Under date 29111 September
1684 occurs the passage‚—‘ The proveists, baillieS, thesaurer, and dean of
gild, being newly elected, took upon their knees the Test.’ As is 56611 from
the list of council at this date, two ‘⁴ extraordinary members '‘ had been im-
posed on it, ‘¹ John earle of Tuciddalc and John Lord Hay of Yester.'' By
an arbitrary stretch of authority, as appears under date 27111 December 1 686,
1116 electior] of the magistrates and council was suspended by royal mandate,
such being a small specimen of the ill-consi‹.lere(l acts which two years later
drove the king from the throne, and 1611 to the Revolution.

What became of the 0111 castlc of PeebleS‚ once the residence of royalty,
and a prime stronghold in this part of the country, is left unexplained hy
any record which we have been able to consult. The last time we see it
mentioned is in the Rental Book os the Earl of Tweeddale’s estates, which
is dated 136611165- Castle, 215111 April 1071 till 1685. Peebles Castle there-
fore existed, though in a decaycd condition, until nearly the close of the
seventeenth century, and shortly afterwards sinking to ruin, it would pro-
bably be removed as building materials. Certainly, it was gone at the
commencement of the eighteenth century. In 1720, 1116 town council
ordered the banks round the castle-hill to be planted with trees. Subse-
quently, a portion of the cleared site of the castle was laid out as a public
bowhng-gmen, and afterwards, the remaining part of the site was required
