lxii INTRODUCTION.

‘¹ thair was brocht 1110 ymage of Sanct Mechel, and of that land was layd
erd and stan in that ymngis lian(l‚’'-—-a singularly grotesque but no doubt
effective ceremonial in the taking and giving possession of lands.

It is observcd from an entry in the reem-ds, 14th June 1462 (p. 145),
that the chaplain at Saint Michael's altar was installed in his office by the
symbol of giving him a glove, and that at demitting office a glove was
resigned into the hand of a bailie. The chaplain referred to in this parti-
cular record is “ Schyr John of Loche.'' In all other instances of minister-
ing priests being referred to, the same term “ Schyr'’ or ‘⁸ 811· ” is prefixed to
their names3 as, for example, “ Sir Wilyam Gybsmm, “ 811 John Smayle''
(p. 146). This title of Sir, given 10 ecclesiastics in the fifteenth and six-
teenth centuries, has, as everybody is aware, been superseded by the term
Revercnd, In quitting Saint Michael, we have to remark that a lane leading
from 1110 “North Rnw ” to Pecbles XVater was called Saint Michael's Wynd,
a name which it still retains, and which was probably derived from the fact
of certain lands bdcmging to the service of St Michael's altar being
situated in its vicinity (pp. 142, 189).

By an entry in the records (p. 204), we learn that the Church of 81
Andrcw was provided with an image of that saint, before which wax
0111111]οε were kept burning. A piece of land is stated to have been held
on psiying annnally *¹ xj s. and viij d. for the vphalding of the wex oandellis
in the pane besor Sanct Andro in the queirf' This establis-hes 1110 fact
that the image had 11 1105111011 111 the choir, or place of peculial* honour. In
the records, the existing roadway up the Old Town is called the “
passand fra Peblcs brig passes 10 Sunt Andros Kirk’' (p. 187).

To resume our history of the royal charters. Passing over several docu-

gat

ments of lesser moment, we come 10 1110 01101101 of confirmation and novo-
‹lamus- by J ames IV„ under his great seal, to 1110 burg-esses and oommunity,
of their privileges and possessions, dated 24th July 1506 (No. XX. p. 35).
It is a more lengthened document than the charter of James IL, and makes
a similar allusion to the old charters and evidents having been burned,
destroyed and annihilated.
