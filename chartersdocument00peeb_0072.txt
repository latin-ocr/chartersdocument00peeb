lxviii INTRODUCTION.

worshippors. The various outbnihlings remained entire after the Reforma-
tion, some portioris of them being used for a school till some tinie in the
eighteenth century, They then sunk to ruin, and gradually disappeared;
but, within the reinembrance of the present writer, the foundations of the
cloisters were still visihle. The church itself, after its desertion in 1784,
also became a ruin; the progress of its delapidaticm being accelerated by
want of care and the irnproper abstraction of materials. The principal
portion now remaining is the shattered ivy-clad tower.

Oontinuing our notes on the charters and records, we corne to that sorely
troubled state of affairs which immediately succeeded the Rcformation. In
the year 1569, during the regency of the Earl of Murray, the Borders,
including the Vale of Tweed‚ were so greatly disturbed by parties of arnied
niaranders that the community of Pcebles found it necessary to increase
their means of defence. The stone dykes which environed the town being
insufficient for protection‚ it was resolved to build a regularly defensible wall.
On this point the records of the burgh are gratifyingly explicit. Beginning
with the 24th February 1569 (p. 31 2), we have a series of entrics regarding
the wall, from which, along with existing relies, we can trace the line of
defence and the nature of its construction. Referring 10 the notices, which
are. worthy of careful perus-al, it is enough to say that the wall was to 110
four ells and a half in height, “ground and all‚’' and three feet and a
half in breadth, with block houses, or projecting towers with shot heles at
certain places. The wall was to begin at thc Η(1011 Fnt‚’y a point on
Twecd Green near the foot of the present Vennel, thence going northwards
10 Lord Borthwick's walls, where it was to turn westwards to Usher’s wynd
and Peebles &Vateiq it was then to run along the foot of the gardcns to
“ Peebles Brig,” after which, going southwards at the XVest Port, it was to
run along the south side of the town “to the said Golt Fut.” The town
was thus to be effectually enclosed, with the four ports w'nich had hitherto
existed in the environing ‹lykes

It is interesting to note the terms on which the wall was to be con-
structed. The authorities possessed no funds adequate for a work of such
