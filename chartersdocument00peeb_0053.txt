PREFACE. xlix

to permit a thorough search to be made for them in the town-house and other
likely places. The permission was at once given, and it was arranged that Mi·
Harl-is and I should take advantage of our first holiday to make an investiga-tion
into every corner where there was any probability of coming upon the papers.
Fortunately, our search was successful. Two presses in the Town Hall, at Peebles,
were found to cont-ain large collectione of papers, ancient and modern, and amongst
these we discovered a considerable number of volumes of reeords of several descrip-
tions, and all, or nearly all the papers which General Hutton had made use of, as
well as others which were not suitable for the purpose he had in view, and were
consequently not transcribed by him.

“ It is observable, from scraps of newspapers placed here and there as marks in
some of the volumes of records, that they have passed through the hands of some
person, within the last twenty years or thereabouts. It seems probable that the
belief in their loss has arisen from the books not having latterly come under the
observation of those qualified to decipher the writingg and, but for the conviction
of their existence, founded on the knowledge derived from General Hutton's volumes,
and the impulse derived from this publication, these valuable records would not at
the present time have been brought to light.

“The whole charters have now been carefully examined, and such of them as
have been considered suitablc for the present purpose have been printed. In cases
where there was merely a copy to print from, the proofs have been collated with
the originale.

ι “ The princip-al chal-ter, that of James VI., 1621, is not recorded in the Register
of the Great Seal. A complete and accurate copy is consequently of the greater
importance. The original deed is written on the face of a large sheet of parchment,
and in several places, particularly at the solas, the material has been entirely worn
away. In others, owing to the action of time and apparently of (lamp, the writing
had faded to such an extent as to be quite undecipherable. In these circumstances,
Mr Marwick applied to the Town Council of Peebles for permission to endeavour
to restore the faded writing by chemical process, so far as to enable it to be read,
and this permission was at once accorded. The chartei· was thereupon placed in the
hands of Mr Dickson, Cui-ator of the Historical Departtnent of the Genera] Register
House, by whom the faded writing was brought up sufficiently to enable him to
complete the transcript. The restored portions now occupy several pages of print.
The whole of the charter was thereafter carefully collated by Mr Dickson, who has
also collated with the Great Seal Register such of the charters as are there re-
