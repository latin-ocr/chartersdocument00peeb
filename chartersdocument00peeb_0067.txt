INTRODUCTION. lxiii

During the minority of Queen Mary, under the protectorate of -Jarnes, Earl
of Arran, a roy-al chartei* was granted, sth June 1543 (No. XXXII. p. 61),
confirming a chartei· by the burgh, and John Lord Hay of chter, consti-
tuting the parish church of St Andrew a collegiate chureh, with a provost‚
twelve prebendaries, and two young persons to assist in chanting divine
service. The document spccifies the titles and services of the respective
prebendaries. They are to be called as follows z—The first, the prebendary
of the blessed virgin Mary of Childbirtl13 the second, the prebendary of
the Holy Rood3 the third, the prebendary of St Michael the archangel3
the fourth, the prebendary of Saint Mary Major3 the fifth, the prebcndary
of the blessed Peter and Paul ; the sixth, the prebendary of Saint John the
Baptist3 the seventlL the prebendary of Saint Mary of Geddes Aisle; the
eighth, the prebendary of Saint Andrew3 the ninth, the prebendary of
Saint James; the tenth, the prebendary of Saint Lawrence3 the elcvcnth,
the prebendary of St Martin3 the twelfth, the prebendary of St Chris-
topher. The whole, for their services at their respective altars, were ‘so be
maintained by rents from certain lands. The original chartei· by the Bur-gh
and Lord Yester has not been discovered, but there is preserved. an extract
from it containing the rental of St Mary, and that extract will be found
in the Appendix to the present volume.

It is to be noticed that this cndowment of “ altarages’' in St Andrew's
Church took place in 1543, only four years previous to the battle of Pinkic-
cleugh, fought lOth September 1547, when the English, under the Protector
somerset, totally defeated the Scots. This unfortunate contest turned
mainly on the question of the Reformation, as carried out by Henry VHL,
against the still intact Church of Rome in Scotland. Strange to say, the com-
munity of Peebles, which had just signalised itself by endowing prebends in
St Andrew's Church, took the side of the English : the circumstance, how-
ever, most likely arose more from the terror inspired by invading hosts all
over the southern counties than from any love for the religion of the
reformers. The fact that the people of Peebles attached themselves to the
English at this national crisis, is curiously brought out in the document
