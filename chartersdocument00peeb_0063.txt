INTRUDUCTION. lix

present century, there survived from fifteen to twenty bastcl-houses in
Peebles. In the progress of street imprswement a number have latterly
been removed, but as many as six still existed in 1870. Between the
bastel-houses in towns, and the fcudal pccl-houscs erected along the linc of
the Tweed, there was a marked resemblance. The object of both was the same.

Edward I. is known to have visited Peebles, and to have granted charters
dated from its royal castlc. In 1304, he assigned Peebles, with its mill
and other pertincnts‚ to Aymer de valence, his VVarden of Scotland.
Robert Bruce, under his designation of Robert 1.‚ is known to have granted
a charter to the burgh of Pcebles, including freedom to hold a fair, but the
document is among the missing State Records.¹ In the year in which
Bruce died, 1329, Peebles was visited by his son, Prince Davidf then a boy
of six years of age, who asccnded the throne as David II„ and during the
early years of whose minority the government was conducted by Randolph,
Earl of Moray. Now ensues a fresh dislocation of political ties. By the
battle of Halidon Hill, 1333, Edward Baliol acquired a temporary and
imperfect possession of the kingdom, and thereafter surrendered to Edward
HL, 1:334, a large portion of the south of Scotland, including the county
of Pecblcs.³ The north-western boundary of the ceded territory was at
Karlynlippis, or Carlops‚ near the northern base of the Pentland range of
hills.⁴ In virtue of this transfer, Peebles was a ‘town under English jurisdic-
tion for fully twenty years, a circumstance not contributing to the safety of
any ancient records which it happened to possess.

The return of David II. from France, where he had been educated,
imparted a gleam of hope to Scotland, but his disastrous defeat at the battle
of Durham, 1346, When he was taken prisoner and carried to London,
threw the country back to its former deplorable condition. Negotiations
for peace, and the ransom and delivery of David, having taken place in 1356,
a parliament met next year to ratify the stipulations. To this important
assemblage of the Scottish Estates Peebles deputed two cornmissioners—
