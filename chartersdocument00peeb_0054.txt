l PREFACE.

coi-ded. The community of Peebles may, accordingly, now be said to possess for
the first time, an accessible and authentic copy of their most valuable Burgh Cli-artem
which has, moreovcr, suffered nothing from the process to which it has been sub·
jected.

‘⁴ As for the Burgh Records, the first preserved volume, beginning in 1456, ends in
1483. Towards the end of that book, statutes of the milies and couneil, and notes
of Burgh court proceedings are of rare occurrence ,- the great majority of the entries
consisting of resignations and sasines of burgh property and annuals. Three volumes,
and the fragment of another, bring down this, the first series of extant Records, to
1567, with the exception of blanks between 1530-4 und 15 41-:3 ,- but the character of
the entries in the latter part of the first volume is kept up, and there is not much of
general interest. Indeed, almost the only items which it was thought desii-able to
extract were those relating to the admission of burgcsses, where the burgcss· money
was directed to be applied for public works, such us stecplc building, bridge-work,
&o This state of matters can only be explained by supposing that suhsequent
to the commeneement of the first volume, the system had been intrmluced of record—
ing the proceedings of the Burgh Oourt :ind the ordinnnoes of thc builies and council
111 a separate volume. There is, however, little room for conjecture 3 for, in a
volume of accounts commencing in 1023, are found portions of the Burgh Court
Eooks, dated respectively 1509 ancl 1520, used as wruppers or covers· for one of
those accounts, viz.y that of 16334.

“ A volume written in Latin, and containing resignations and sasines, services of
heirs, and instruments hy not-aries, commences in 1549, and ends in 1565. A few
enti-ies have been taken from this volume, which is lai-gely composed of matter not
rclating to the Burgh, but to persons and places throughout the county and district.

⁴‘ Between 1554 and 1573, there are two volume-s containing the statutes and
proceedings of the bailies and the council, and these registers have been largely
drawn upon for extraets which will be found in the present volume. From the latter
date till 1604, the only volume which exists is a Register of Sasines commencing in
1594.

“In 1604, the system of keeping the transactions of the provost, bailiesy aud
council separate from those of the magistrates sitting in the Bur-gh Court, was in
operation. From about this time, therefore, there are, in addition to the sasine
registers, two sets of reem-ds, the Couneil Record and Burgh Court Book.
