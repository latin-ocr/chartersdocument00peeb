of Saint Nieholas and the “Haly Rude of Peebles,'’ which for ages had
been devoutly flocked to by pilgrims from all parts of Scotland.

We have a glinipse of the expulsion of the brotherhood of the Holy
Crass. Gilbert Broune, the superior of the convent, casts up again in the
reeords on the 27111 January 1560, which according to the old mode
of reckoning came after the 30th March of the sanie year. On this
occasion he obeys the Lords of the Congregation, by delivering up the
Cross Church to tho bailies and 6011111131]111118Γ his brethren to disperse. He
takes care, however, to protest that he and other ineinbers of the convent
rendered obediencc on the understanding that they were severally to enjoy
the endowments of the church during their lives. To this they were
reasonably entitled, but their deinission of office on an attempt to secure
these ternis has an unpleasantly sordid aspect.

What about St Andrew's Church during this coniinotion 2 Nothing very
satisfactory can be said on the subject. It has been already mentioned, on
the saith of the records, that this ancient parish church was burnt and
destroyed by forces in the service of England about twelve years before the

destroyed, is evident from the fact that on the 2‘7th May 1555 (p. 213),
Charles Geddes desires the bailies to ⁴‘ rep-air and big the Goddes ile‚⁷’ and
from the still more conclusive fact that on the Mth October, sanie year
(p. 218), “ 1116 inquest ordanis the baillics and nyehtbouris pas to the Kirk
and sycht the sainyn with witty men to 56. qnhow it may be big-git.‘’ It is
not stated that the edifice was rebuilt. Yet there was probably some kind of
restoration, for on the 13th January 1557 (p. 242), the bailies insist that
the prebendaries shall make continual and daily service at their respective
altars, conformable to endowment by the patrous. A similar entry occurs
two years previously (p. 226), warning “all chaplains to lnak residence at
thair altaris conform to thair fundatioun within xlj dayis,” under penalty
